#Why Two Different Maps SDK(Mapbox,Google Maps)?

**Answer:** Using Mapbox,we can have different map styles,navigation routes with their UI.
But,MapBox does not have any API that can give us data about the nearby places,for example,we can't get the list of hospitals 
near the user's location with Mapbox.So I used Google Maps Places API which provide the data used in this App.So
(Mapbox Map Styles + Mapbox Navigation Routes UI + Google Maps Places Data)
